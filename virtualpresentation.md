Thank you for the time you put into preparing your work for presentation at the SIGCSE 2020 Technical Symposium. All of us - authors, reviewers, and committee members - poured our hearts and souls into putting together the best possible symposium for the community and all of us are incredibly disappointed that we were not able to meet in person this year.  We know many of you had presentations ready to go and would like a way to share your content.  

We are creating an online portal for sharing content from the SIGCSE 2020 Technical Symposium with the broader community. Participation in this portal is completely voluntary, and the proceedings will NOT be changed whether or not you choose to make your presentation available through this portal.

**We sent an email to all authors with the link for submission.** If you didn't get an email about this option, please email <a href="mailto:program@sigcse2020.org">program@sigcse2020.org</a>
