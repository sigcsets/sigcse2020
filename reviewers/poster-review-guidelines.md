## Overview

[Posters](../authors/posters.html) provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper.

Posters should not be previously published, as a paper or a poster.

**Remember that poster proposal review is not blind.** Reviewers will be able to see the names of submitting authors, however, authors will not be able to to see the reviewers’ names.

Poster will be displayed for a 2-hour time period during the conference. Authors will be expected to “present” their poster at that time. At least one author for each accepted poster must register for and attend the conference. The space available for a poster will be 4 feet high by 8 feet wide, possibly with a small shelf below. 


## Review Guidelines

Keep in mind that posters are meant to be a place to present and receive feedback on work that is in progress. Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.


Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work; provide their familiarity with the submission topic; provide numeric scores related to background and related work, approach and uniqueness, and results and contribution; identify strengths and weaknesses of the submissions; and provide an overall evaluation.  Reviewers may provide confidential comments to the program committee to address concerns about the submission. These comments will not be shared with submitting authors.
