## Overview

The [Nifty Assignments](../authors/nifty.html) project gathers great CS assignments to make their ideas and materials freely available for the CSE community.  

To review for Nifty Assignments, you need to read and evaluate 5 submissions. Each submission is an assignment along with all its materials. If you have a conflict of interest with an assignment, just write that as your evaluation and don't score it.

## Review Guidelines

As a reviewer, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes the assignment and its fit as a Nifty Assignment. When reviewing a submission, consider:

* Is this a great assignment?
* Does it teach topics of interest to many?
* Are the materials high quality and adoptable by others?
* Is it different from assignments that have already been published by Nifty Assignments?
