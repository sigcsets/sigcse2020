## Overview

[Demos](../authors/demos.html) provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting. Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. Demos take place during break periods and will last 45 minutes.

**Proposals undergo review but not blind review.**

## Review Guidelines

Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.

Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work, provide their familiarity with the submission topic, describe the expected audience, identify strengths and weaknesses of the submissions, and provide an overall evaluation.  Reviewers may provide confidential comments to the program committee to address concerns about the submission. These comments will not be shared with submitting authors.
