## SIGCSE 2019 General Review Process

The general review process covers submissions (grouped by submission date):

* [**Group 1**](#group-1-timeline): [Panels](../authors/panels.html), [Special Sessions](../authors/specialsessions.html), [workshops](../authors/workshops.html)
* [**Group 2**](#group-2-timeline): [Nifty Assignments](../authors/nifty.html), [BoFs](../authors/bofs.html), [Posters](../authors/posters.html), [Demos](../authors/demos.html), [Lightning talks](../authors/lightningtalks.html), and [ACM Student Research Competition](../authors/src.html).  

(If you are reviewing for [Papers](../authors/papers.html), please refer to the [Paper Review Process](paper-review-process.html)).

Reviewers provide high-quality reviews for submissions to provide authors with feedback so they may improve their work for presentation or future submission.

Each submission will receive 3 reviews.  

All reviews are submitted through EasyChair.   Reviewers are considered "Ordinary PC members" in EasyChair.

Only Lightning Talks are anonymous for review.  All other submissions covered in this document are *not* anonymized.

The Track Chairs for a given track will lead any discussion and will make recommendations of acceptance to the Program Chairs for each track.

As a reviewer, you will need to [update your reviewer profile](#reviewer-profile), (optionally) [bid on papers you're interested in reviewing](#bid), [review](#review), and [discuss the submission with the track chairs](#discussion).

### Reviewer Profile

When you receive your invitation to review for SIGCSE 2019, please take a few moments to update your profile and select 3-5 topics that you are most qualified for reviewing.  To do so, select **SIGCSE 2019 > My topics** from the menu.  

Please check at most 5 topics!  More topics will make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. 

### Bid

Only Group 1 tracks will have a bidding period.  If you do not bid, we will use topics to assign submissions for review.

Reviewers will bid on submissions they are interested in reviewing after the submission deadline.  Please bid for submissions where the title and abstract are in your area of expertise.  Bidding will help with assigning submissions for review that you're qualified and interested in reviewing!

### Review

Before starting your review, you may be asked by the Track Chairs to declare conflicts with any submitting authors.  Please do so in a timely manner so we can avoid conflicts during assignment.

As a **reviewer**, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes what you believe the submission to be about.  When reviewing a submission, consider:

* The strengths and weaknesses, 
* The contribution to an outstanding SIGCSE 2019 program and experience for attendees, and
* How it brings new ideas or extends current ideas through replication to the field and practitioners and researchers of computer science education.

Each track may have their own reviewer guidelines.  Please refer to those as you're completing your review as instructed by the track chair. 

Please **do not** include your preference for acceptance or rejection of a submission in the feedback to the authors.  Instead, use the provided radio buttons to make a recommendation based on your summary review and provide any details in the confidential comments to the track chairs.  As a reviewer, you will only see a small portion of the submissions and a paper that you recommend for acceptance may be rejected when considering the full set of submissions.

### Discussion

The discussion and recommendation period provides the opportunity for track chairs to discuss reviews and feedback so they can provide the best recommendation for acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs.  We ask that reviewers engage in discussion when prompted by other reviewers or the track chairs by using the Comments feature of EasyChair.  During this period you will be able to revise your review based on the discussion, but you are not required to do so.

Track chairs will make a final recommendation to the Program Chairs from your feedback.
