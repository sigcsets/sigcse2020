The workforce will see (r)evolutionary changes in the workplace at the human?technology frontier. Participants will be asked to think strategically about how we will reach the future we want to live. Content delivery mechanisms and active learning/project-based experiences for undergraduate students have developed and matured at a dramatic pace in recent years. How can we leverage what we already know, working to improve and broaden undergraduate STEM education and computing education in particular? How do we prepare students to solve the wicked societal problems of the future? Will students require problem-solving skills that transcend disciplines? Is interdisciplinarity teachable at the undergraduate computer science level? Which skills/knowledge will employers and graduate schools require in 10/20 years? The National Science Foundation Division of Undergraduate Education is preparing to have a nationwide dialogue with STEM communities and industry partners on this topic. Participants in this highly interactive session will collectively construct a shared vision for the future of computing sciences education, and outline a research agenda for the future.

3/11/2020,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Innovation in Undergraduate Data Science Education,C120,"<p>The workshop will allow participants to gain experience with a series of innovations
developed at UC Berkeley that have enabled the teaching of undergraduate data science at
scale to students from all backgrounds. Rather than beginning with established introductory
strategies as the gateway to computer science, students in the ""Foundations of Data Science""
(Data 8) learn computational skills and concepts in relation to real world issues and with
attention to societal implications. By engaging with students' interest in the applications of
computing on data, and integrating societal impact from the start, the program has developed
long term commitment to advance computational skills for large numbers of students.</p>

<p>These innovations in teaching not only convey important computational content, but also
broaden participation beyond existing approaches to computer science, and integrate issues of
human contexts and ethics throughout the full curriculum. Goals include increasing diversity
among students learning computer science, giving students a strong ethical foundations within
their computer science work, and encouraging critical thinking in the application of inference and
statistical techniques.

3/11/2020,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,NSF Institute Planning workshop (SIGCSE Pre-symposium event),C125,"<p>Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) is now in widespread use across virtually all of the discipline. Understanding PDC is essential for being able to make use of most computational resources as well as grasping a wide range of cybersecurity risks. Yet undergraduate computer science and engineering education still focuses on the sequential model of computational thinking that was developed around 20th century computing platforms, creating a bias against thinking in terms of parallel and distributed problem solutions. The CDER center has received funding from NSF to gather input from all the stakeholder communities for guiding a major initiative to transform undergraduate curricula to incorporate PDC as a foundational element of computational thinking, akin to the transformation from structured to object-oriented programming. This meeting will use the World Cafe discussion model to maximize the opportunity for participants to brainstorm ideas. Participants must pre-register for the meeting, and commit to reading preparatory materials that are intended to help initiate the discussions from a shared understanding. Walk-in observers are welcome.</p><p>More details may be found at <a href=""http://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/"">http://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/</a>.</p>",Sushil Prasad; Charles Weems; R.

3/11/2020,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Computing for Social Good in Education,B110,"<p>Computing for Social Good in Education (CSG-Ed) provides an opportunity for learning technical and professional skills while reinforcing computing's social relevance. This FREE SIGCAS-sponsored pre-symposium event will allow participants to learn how to incorporate CSG-Ed into their classroom in two ways.</p>
<p>The morning will focus on Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS), particularly on development of ""HFOSS kits"". An HFOSS kit provides an isolated environment built with artifacts from an active HFOSS project that can be used to learn and practice software skills. For example, a kit containing a code base, issue tracker, and revision control history could support learning related to version control. HFOSS kits provide the complexity and scale of the real project while allowing students to explore a socially beneficial application. Short presentations will provide the foundation for a breakout session to explore ideas for development of HFOSS kits.</p><p>Details about the morning session may be found at: <a href=""http://foss2serve.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2020_POSSE_Roundup"">http://foss2serve.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2020_POSSE_Roundup</a>.</p>
<p>The afternoon will focus on techniques for incorporating CSG-Ed projects into the introductory computing curricula. Participants will learn how to reframe existing projects or develop new programming projects as CSG-Ed focused assignments, as well as how to utilize open data repositories as both data set source and inspiration for projects ideas.</p><p>Details about the afternoon session may be found at: <a href=""http://www.sigcas.org/csged"">http://www.sigcas.org/csged</a></p>
<p>It is commonly believed that incorporating the social relevance of computing in the curriculum requires significant instructor time and can only be undertaken in the upper division courses. The goal of the afternoon session is to train the attendees on class-proven techniques for introducing CSG-Ed from CS0 onward with little extra effort for the instructor.</p>",Gregory Hislop; Mikey Goldweber; Heidi Ellis; Lori Postner; Lisa Kaczmarczyk; Grant Braught; Rick Blumenthal; Herman Jackson; Darci Burdge; Karl Wurst,ALLDAY
3/11/2020,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Professional Development Workshop for Teaching-Track Faculty,B113,"<p>Undergraduate enrollment in Computer Science and interest of non-majors taking CS courses continues to increase. To meet the increased course demand, many Ph.D. granting departments have added or are actively recruiting teaching faculty (typically with academic rank) to their faculty. The one-day workshop will focus on the professional development of teaching track faculty (professor of practice, instructor, clinical faculty, lecturer, etc.) in Ph.D. granting departments. The workshop fills a crucial need as many departments have limited experience on how to mentor, evaluate, and promote this new type of faculty. The sessions will focus on how teaching faculty can strategize their involvement in departmental as well as research activities, different forms of scholarship and leadership activities to pursue, and best practices for success, promotion, and advancement. Academic leaders involved in supervising and evaluating teaching track faculty will provide their perspective and insights.</p><p>Apply at <a href=""https://cra.org/crae/professional-development-workshop-for-teaching-track-faculty-at-sigcse-2020/"">https://cra.org/crae/professional-development-workshop-for-teaching-track-faculty-at-sigcse-2020/</a>.</p>",Lori Pollock; Christine Alvarado; Susanne Hambrusch; Geoffrey Herman,ALLDAY
3/11/2020,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,"New Educators Wednesday Roundtable, NEWR 2020",B115,"<p>A successful career as a college or university computer science educator involves more than a deep understanding of a research area. Yet many new CS educators experience relatively little
educator training - and face more questions than answers, e.g., What career-path choices do CS educators pursue? How do I find an institution or career path that is right for me? How can I balance teaching, research, service, and a life beyond all those things? What are the balancing acts involved in working effectively with colleagues and managing the advancement and tenure process? What tips could help me organize a course, scaffold engaging experiences, and build lasting relationships with students? The New Educators Wednesday Roundtable is designed to assist aspiring and early-career educators in exploring the non-research facets of an academic career. Experienced faculty from a variety of career paths and institution types will share their experiences and best practices. Through small-group discussions attendees will focus on questions and concerns relevant to their situations -- and will widen their cohort of colleagues at similar stages of their career.</p><p>Application and more details are available at: <a href=""https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~zdodds/NEWR2020/"">https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~zdodds/NEWR2020/</a>.</p>",Zachary Dodds; Diane Horton,ALLDAY
3/11/2020,8:30 AM,5:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Programming Quantum Computers: Tools and Techniques for the Undergraduate CSCI Faculty,E145,"<p>As quantum computers are poised to kick-start a new computer revolution the fact remains that for more than twenty years almost every popular article that's ever been written on the subject has taken an easy way out, and has described quantum computers in ways that sound cool but are not very accurate. While everybody correctly recognizes the importance of quantum computers for the future of science and technology, the topic actually remains one of the most misrepresented in science. The purpose of this full day event is to correct that and to offer educators (in a hands-on environment) a very concrete set of tools, techniques and materials that would enable them to bring the core aspects of quantum computation to the classroom. To this end we have partnered with O'Reilly Media and will be featuring their new book entitled ""Programming Quantum Computers"" written by Eric R (""EJ"") Johnston, with co-authors Nic Harrigan and Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia. So far it has been hard to anticipate exactly how quantum computers could be used because quantum computing represents such a new way of processing information, but we have reached a very significant point where devices have sufficient power and are so readily available (to virtually anyone) in the cloud that it's imperative to start teaching this technology to raise a new generation of scientists ready to develop it further.</p>

The goals of the workshop will be to (a) build capacity in understanding the how/when/why of the use of formative classroom assessment among the K-12 CS educator community, (b) share (and get feedback on) the foundational work done by the team of researchers and teachers on the project to create taxonomies by which to organize the assessments, and identify coverage and gaps; and (c) recruit interested teachers and researchers at the workshops to join in activities related to reviewing, sharing, creating, curating, and tagging assessments on Edfinity (i.e. grow the CoP).</p><p>More information available at: <a href=""http://csassess.org"">http://csassess.org</a>.</p>",Bryan Twarek; Shuchi Grover; Kelly Powers; Sangeeta Bhatnagar,MORNING
3/11/2020,8:30 AM,12:00 PM,Pre-Symposium,Sculpting Accreditation Criteria for Data Science - a Working Session,B112,"<p>The data science field has experienced unprecedented growth over the past few years, as organizations across the globe continue to ramp up the hiring of qualified personnel. Given this employer demand for data science graduates, several institutions have created their own versions of data science programs at the bachelor's and master's levels. Entities such as the ACM, NSF and the National Academies have attempted to define curriculum for baccalaureate data science programs to begin the development of a shared understanding of the data science discipline, which is critical for employers, institutions and students alike.</p>
 
<p>To further develop this shared understanding, a task force representing diverse constituents has been exploring the possible accreditation criteria for data science programs for the past year. This hands-on working session will allow attendees to participate and contribute to this effort. This interactive session will include: (1) a review of the project objectives and work to date, (2) an analysis of vital stakeholders and project scope, (3) a detailed timeline of key deliverables, (4) a presentation of the committee's strawdog data science program criteria, (5) a working session for attendees to review and refine strawdog data science criteria, and (6) identification of programs potentially interested in data science accreditation.</p>
 
<p>There is no charge for this working session, but registration is required. Space is limited. Registrations will be honored on a first-come-first-served basis.

Over a half dozen experienced organizations and academic institutions have jumped in to meet this need, including the Beauty and Joy of Computing, Bootstrap, UTeach Computer Science, Exploring Computer Science, and Mobile CSP. Two years have passed since the initial offerings of professional development opportunities under the 2016 CSTA Computer Science For All Community Giving initiative, but year-after-year, there has been no community for all providers or teachers to discuss best practices, feedback, or share teaching experiences. The CSP Providers and Teachers Forum aims to increase collaboration and discussion among College Board endorsed providers and teachers by offering an agenda that can include sharing successes and failures of professional development, reviewing common teaching issues providers and teachers encounter, discussing strategies for teacher recruitment and keeping in touch with teachers, and preparing for and reading results of the AP CS Principles exam.</p><p>More information may be found at: <a href=""http://bjc.berkeley.edu/sigcse-csp-forum"">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/sigcse-csp-forum</a>.</p>",Zachary Dodds; Diane Horton,MORNING
