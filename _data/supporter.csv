3/12/2020,10:45 AM,12:00 PM,Supporter Session,Taking Your Students from GitHub Newbies to Pull Request Masters,,"<p><b>Sponsored by GitHub</b></p><p>Teaching your students to use version control and GitHub can be a challenge, particularly when the students are also new to programming.  Mike Zamanksy, GitHub Campus Advisor, will go through a sequence of steps that can be used over the course of one or more classes that will take students from using GitHub to retrieve code all the way to sophisticated team version control.  We start by having students pull code samples from a repo.  From there they move on to basic Git and GitHub use.  We follow this with more advanced concepts such as merges and later pull requests and branches.  All this is done in conjunction with GitHub Classroom.  This process has been successfully used at both the high school and College levels.</p><img src=""https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/images/supporters/200s/github-education-200.jpg"" alt=""GitHub Logo"" width=""200px"">",Mike Zamansky,GitHub
3/12/2020,10:45 AM,12:00 PM,Supporter Session,"How Ubiquitous, On-demand Computing Is Changing Scientific Data Analysis",,"<p><b>Sponsored by Google</b></p><p>Cloud computing is evolving, from rented infrastructure (""infrastructure as a service"") to fully managed services (""platform as a service"") that enable the creation of complete workflows in the cloud (""software as a service"").  This trend has huge implications for how science and scientific analysis is carried out.  For example, cheap, connected sensors (""internet of things"") and auto-scaled data analysis open up streaming data analysis and adaptive sensors.  In addition, the data that is collected as a result can be analyzed at scale, and much of the data analysis automated due to the increasing ability of machine learning services to understand the unstructured data.  This session will highlight resources that will behlp attendees learn more about this exciting field.</p><img src=""https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/images/supporters/200s/google-200.png"" alt=""Google Logo"" width=""200px"">

3/12/2020,3:45 PM,5:00 PM,Supporter Session,Using CodeLab in the Canvas LMS,,"<p><b>Sponsored by Turing's Craft, Inc.</b></p><p>CodeLab is an online, automated, interactive learning tool for students in programming courses. The CodeLab service provides hundreds of very short, focused coding exercises that help students gain mastery over the syntax, semantics and common usage patterns of language constructs and programming ideas. Code submissions for each exercise are automatically checked for correctness and students are given relevant hints in case of incorrect code.</p>
<p>CodeLab now seamlessly integrates with the popular Canvas LMS.  In this session we will show an example Canvas course containing a CodeLab integration, take a quick look at how the Canvas gradebook integrates CodeLab exercises and demo the straightforward process of setting up a CodeLab course in Canvas.  In the second half of the session, we will present several updated tools to help instructors using CodeLab to combat plagiarism in the system.</p><img src=""https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/images/supporters/200s/turingscraft-200.png"" alt=""Turing's Craft, Inc.

ABET made significant changes to the curriculum and student outcomes criteria for computing programs in 2018 based on new and updated guidelines from professional computing organizations such as the ACM.  The speakers will discuss lessons learned from evaluating computing programs under the revised criteria in 2018 and 2019 including the first programs accredited under the new cybersecurity program criteria.  They will also introduce ABET's draft associate cybersecurity program criteria recently developed for 2-year cybersecurity programs.  This session will be of particular interest to computing programs considering initial ABET accreditation or seeking reaccreditation in the next few years.</p><img src=""https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/images/supporters/200s/abet-200.png"" alt=""ABET Logo"" width=""200px"">","David Gibson; Michael Oudshoorn

3/13/2020,1:45 PM,3:00 PM,Supporter Session,How Google Supports and Uses CS Education Research,,"<p><b>Sponsored by Google</b></p><p>Unlike other disciplines, computer science (CS) does not yet have an extensive body of rigorous educational research to help us make good decisions about how CS is best taught and learned.  With post-secondary CS programs operating significantly beyond capacity, and many states mandating CS for all K-12 students, this lack of knowledge is seriously impinging on our capacity to best serve an increasing number of students.  This session focuses on the ways in which Google is supporting and using computer science education research.  Attendees will learn about several programs that provide funding to encourage and support research to evaluate and improve its programs.</p><img src=""https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/images/supporters/200s/google-200.png"" alt=""Google Logo"" width=""200px"">",Chris Stephenson,Google
3/13/2020,3:34 PM,5:00 PM,Supporter Session,What do Students Really Want and Need in CS1?  And How Does That Compare With What Instructors Think? ,,"<p><b>Sponsored by ZyBooks</b></p><p>This is not your everyday supporter session.  Rather than a product demo, we'll use this time to hear from real students about their CS1 experiences.  What worked and what didn't?  What do they want and need in CS1?  What did instructors think was the greatest thing since sliced bread that students ended up hating?  How do they view flipped classrooms, pair programming, auto-grading, self-chosen projects, peer instruction, help from upperclassmen, and similar items.  And how could those items be improved?  We'll also hear from instructors, including what they *think* students want and need, what's worked and what hasn't, and their ideas for improving.  The session will be run in a fun, game-like manner.  We welcome students and instructors to join, provide their input, or just listen and learn how to become better at their own learning or teaching.  What's in it for us, zyBooks?  Our professor-formed company's mission is to help students succeed (especially in CS) and to help teachers teach.  So we hope to learn how to create products that will better serve you.</p><img src=""https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/images/supporters/200s/zybooks-200.jpg"" alt=""ZyBooks Logo"" width=""200px"">",Smita Bakshi; Frank Vahid; Roman Lysecky,ZyBooks
