Paper Session,What Are Cybersecurity Education Papers About? A Systematic Literature Review of SIGCSE and ITiCSE Conferences,"<p><strong>3rd Best Paper, CS Education Research Track</strong><br /><br />Cybersecurity is now more important than ever, and so is education in this field. However, the cybersecurity domain encompasses an extensive set of concepts, which can be taught in different ways and contexts. To understand the state of the art of cybersecurity education and related research, we examine papers from the ACM SIGCSE and ACM ITiCSE conferences. From 2010 to 2019, a total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors. We discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security), and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well. The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset. Our results provide orientation in the area, a synthesis of trends, and implications for further research. Therefore, they are relevant for instructors, researchers, and anyone new in the field of cybersecurity education. The information we collected and synthesized from individual papers are organized in a publicly available dataset.</p>",Valdemar Švábenský; Jan Vykopal; Pavel Čeleda,Sub,10.1145/3328778.3366816,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366816,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIpgOrcFvzI,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cTMg0GwKJUwbnOubzDsKPSsuN0L-F1hE
Paper Session,Integration and Evaluation of Spiral Theory based Cybersecurity Modules into Core Computer Science and Engineering Courses,"<p>Cybersecurity education has been emphasized by several national organizations in the United States, including the National Academy of Engineering, which recognizes securing cyberspace as one of the 14 Engineering Grand Challenges. To prepare students for such challenges and to enhance cybersecurity education opportunities at our large research university, we implemented an NSF-funded cybersecurity education project. This project is a collaborative effort between faculty and graduate students in the Engineering Education, Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CPE) departments at a major US research university. In this effort, we integrated cybersecurity learning modules into multiple existing core CS and CPE courses following Jerome Bruner's spiral-theory model, which has previously been used to reformulate several academic curricula. </p> <p>In this paper, we present our cybersecurity curriculum initiative, describe the spiral-theory based process we developed to implement the curriculum and provide an in-depth description of four reusable cybersecurity learning modules that we developed. A core tenet of spiral theory holds to revisit topics as students advance through their curriculum. This work applies this approach to Cybersecurity education by carefully designing the learning objectives of the modules and its contents. For evaluating these learning modules we implemented pre and post-tests to assess students' technical knowledge, their perceptions towards the modules' learning objectives, and how it influenced their motivation to learn cybersecurity. Our findings are overwhelmingly positive and the students' feedback has helped us improve these learning modules. Since its inception, our initiative has educated more than 2,000 students and is currently being used to revise the affected courses' syllabi.</p>",Debarati Basu; Harinni K. Kumar; Vinod K.

Paper Session,"A Case Study of a Cybersecurity Programme: Curriculum Design, Resource Management, and Reflections","<p>Cybersecurity is an area of growing international importance. In response to global shortages of Cybersecurity skills, many universities have introduced degree programmes in Cybersecurity. These programmes aim to prepare students to become Cybersecurity practitioners with advanced skills in a timely manner. Several universities offer Cybersecurity degrees, but these have been developed ad hoc, as there is currently no internationally accepted Cybersecurity curriculum.</p><p>Recently, an ITiCSE working group on global perspectives on Cybersecurity education developed a competency-based framework that aims to help institutions to implement Cybersecurity programmes. In this report, we present a case study of a Cybersecurity programme at the University of Auckland. We discuss how the curriculum and resource management of this programme evolved, and we present some challenges for the design and delivery of a Cybersecurity programme in the light of this competency-based framework.</p>",Muhammad Rizwan Asghar; Andrew Luxton-Reilly,Sub,10.1145/3328778.3366918,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366918,0,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1M_n4xWDheqXDZtSi0NlYYEwNb17ckr1E

Paper Session,A Longitudinal View of Gender Balance in a Large Computer Science Program,"<p>Computer Science has a persistent lack of women's participation. In order to best effect change, we require a more fine-grain analysis of the gender disparity as it changes throughout an undergraduate Computer Science curriculum. In this paper, we use a quantitative approach to highlight, with greater specificity, the point in an undergraduate career where gender balance changes. We also examine the role of grades in students' decisions to stay in the course sequence. Our goal is to enable targeted interventions that will make Computer Science a more welcoming discipline. Our study examines 30,890 unique student records over ten years at a large, public research institution. The records include students who took a Computer Science course over the past ten years. The dataset contains information about gender, majors, minors, academic level, and GPA. The dataset also includes a record from each course taken by each student and their final grade. We observed a modest increase in women's participation in all Computer Science courses over the past ten years. Despite this increase, the gender disparity is still large. Through our analysis, we found that women consistently choose not to continue through the Computer Science sequence at a higher rate than men. This higher attrition could be linked to women receiving lower grades in most introductory CS courses despite having the same or higher GPAs than men. Our results reveal specific areas where intervention can be the most effective in changing the stubborn gender disparity in Computer Science. </p>",Amy Baer; Andrew DeOrio,Sub,10.1145/3328778.3366806,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366806,https://youtu.be/lJAZlTnhBI8,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eeglv9_IRDBccQfpUgyZF46O3_zm2qaI
Paper Session,Identifying the Prevalence of the Impostor Phenomenon Among Computer Science Students,"<p>The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) is often discussed as a problem in the field of computer science, but there has yet to be an empirical study to establish its prevalence among CS students. One survey by the Blind app found that a high number of software engineers at some of the largest technology companies self-reported feelings of Impostor Syndrome; however, self-reporting of Impostor Syndrome is not the standard diagnostic for identifying whether an individual exhibits feelings of the Impostor Phenomenon. In this work, the established Clance IP Scale is used to identify the prevalence of IP among graduate and undergraduate computer science students at a large research-intensive North American institution. Among this population of over 200 students, 57% were found to exhibit frequent feelings of the Impostor Phenomenon with a larger fraction of women (71%) experiencing frequent feelings of the Imposter Phenomenon than men (52%). Additionally, IP was found to have greater prevalence among computer science students than among students of other populations from comparable studies. Due to the negative impacts associated with feelings of the Impostor Phenomenon, computer science education should work to improve student awareness and help student cope with these feelings.</p>",Adam Rosenstein; Aishma Raghu; Leo Porter,Sub,10.1145/3328778.3366815,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366815,https://youtu.be/lg6UmC8KuAU,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qnF9Hbu3Vbibzf0GmNtiEN4WGKR3qeVJ
Paper Session,A Multi-level Analysis of the Relationship between Instructional Practices and Retention in Computer Science,"<p>Increasing retention in computer science (CS) courses is a goal of many CS departments. A key step to increasing retention is to understand the factors that impact the likelihood students will continue to enroll in CS courses. Prior research on retention in CS has mostly examined factors such as prior exposure to programming and students' personality characteristics, which are outside the control of undergraduate instructors. This study focuses on factors within the control of instructors, namely, instructional practices that directly impact students' classroom experiences. Participants were recruited from 25 sections of 14 different courses over 4 semesters. A multi-level model tested the effects of individual and class-average perceptions of cooperative learning and teacher directedness on the probability of subsequent enrollment in a CS course, while controlling for students' mastery of CS concepts and status as a CS major. Results indicated that students' individual perceptions of instructional practices were not associated with retention, but the average rating of cooperative learning within a course section was negatively associated with retention. Consistent with prior research, greater mastery of CS concepts and considering or having declared a CS major were associated with a higher probability of taking a future CS courses. Implications for findings are discussed.</p>",Markeya Peteranetz; Leen-Kiat Soh,Sub,10.1145/3328778.3366812,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366812,https://use.vg/jwRYQb,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WO4rUp8FOAJxN8e-P69D2ahDSpUxpQbF
