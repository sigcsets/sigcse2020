Special Session,Session 1I: CC2020 -- Visualization Tool Preview and Review,"<p>The CC2020 project was charged with two main objectives, to produce a comprehensive report and a visualization tool to provide global guidance in an evolving computing environment as it affects computing baccalaureate degree programs worldwide. The report is now in draft form and has undergone four rounds of review. The other goal of the CC2020 project is to develop a set of visualization-based tools that will help users to explore questions they may have concerning curricular guidelines, as well as local computing curricula. A visualization tool has been scoped and a prototype built. This special session will unveil the prototype for the SIGCSE community who will have the opportunity to view and review the tool.</p>",Alison Clear; Shingo Takada; Ernesto Cuadros Vargas,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366998,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366998,,
Panel,Session 1J: Researching Race in Computer Science Education: Demystifying Key Vocabulary and Methods,"<p>Diversity and inclusion are popular topics at SIGCSE. However, few researchers examine questions specifically focused on race. Such research is of great interest to the SIGCSE community, but is typically conducted by education faculty and published in education journals. This panel attempts to introduce attendees to relevant background and methods, such that attendees can more easily understand and contribute to computer science education research related to race. This panel attempts to bridge our two communities by inviting race scholars from education to share their expertise with computer science education researchers and practitioners.</p>",Colleen Lewis; Joanna Goode; Allison Scott; Niral Shah; Sepehr Vakil,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366965,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366965,https://youtu.be/5AgKRUVvKKE,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gzIMGtCnUdJTwl891FVIjxFoX5OCOYhY
Panel,Session 1K: RESET (Re-Enter STEM through Emerging Technology): Finding Re-Entry Pathways for Women,"<p>One of the critical needs of the 21st-century workforce development is the recruitment, retention, and graduation of women in STEM fields. Research suggests that women drop out of academic programs and leave the workforce to deal with financial setbacks, tend to personal obligations and offer service in military programs. It is important these women, i.e. returning women, have pathways for reentry to college and opportunities to advance their careers. Some areas within STEM fields, such as Emerging Technology (EmTech) in computer science are expected to experience increases in job opportunities more quickly than traditional areas. The demands of these jobs can only be fulfilled by creating pathways for untapped STEM talent pools, including returning women. Therefore, we propose a panel to discuss the barriers and opportunities women face (re-)entering the STEM education and career paths, especially in EmTech fields. The panel of experts will provide different perspectives to spark conversation and reflection. The objective of the panel is to share experiences, advice, and ideas to advance the current state of knowledge about the complex challenges that women encounter and support structures for their reentry to the education and professional pipeline.</p>",Farzana Rahman; Elodie Billionniere; Quincy Brown; Ann Quiroz Gates,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366963,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366963,,
Panel,Session 1L: Using Data to Inform Computing Education Research and Practice,"<p>The analysis of data plays an increasingly critical role in computing education research, enabled by more and larger datasets, more powerful analysis techniques and better infrastructure for sharing. This panel brings together four panellists at various stages of work involving the collection and analysis of large datasets in different fields of computing education. The panellists will each discuss the current state of their work, the unique aspects of their data, and how that data fits into the larger landscape of computing education and research. Panellists will be asked to explain how they are employing AI and data mining techniques to learn about learners, the research methods they have used to make this happen, and any significant key findings they have discovered through this processes. The panel will discuss emerging topics, including: going beyond log data, handling global-scale datasets, efficiently collaborating with cross-dataset analysis, and ethical and privacy considerations. After the panelists present (5 minutes each), the moderator will pose follow-up questions and invite the audience to pose additional questions or provide other feedback. Key takeaways will include how data mining and artificial intelligence can contribute to improved insight and learning gains and how the larger computer education community can participate in data collection or analysis.</p>",Thomas Price; Baker Franke (not attending 2020); Shuchi Grover; Monica M.

Special Session,Session 2I: SIGCSE Reads 2020: Author Discussion and Q & A,"<p>This special session furthers the work associated with SIGCSE Reads and the growing community of SIGCSE members who connect to each other through science fiction. The session starts with a practical experience addressing one of the five common goals presented previously: a learning experience for participants in how science fiction can be used in computing classrooms to teach ethics and develop CS students' facility for considering ethical situations with deeper critical thinking. Materials will be available so that the exercise can be translated to other classrooms. This will be followed by a significant Q & A session with one of this year's authors, Hugo Award winner David D.

Panel,Session 2K: Who Has a Seat at the Table in CSed? Rethinking Equity Through the Lens of Decision-making and Power in Computer Science Education Initiatives,"<p>Who makes decisions about what K-12 computer science education(CSed) should look like? While equitable participation is a central focus of K-12 CSed, the field has largely thought about equity through the lens of providing access to inclusive and robust CS learning. But issues of who has a ""seat at the table"" in determining the shape of those experiences, and the larger field that structures them, have been largely under-explored. This panel session argues that equitable CSed must take into account questions of participation in decision-making about CSed, with such issues of power themselves a key dimension of equity in any education effort. We highlight efforts engaging stakeholders from across the education landscape-parents, educators, community members, administrators, and students-exploring how decision-making is structured, how voices that are usually marginalized might be elevated, the tensions involved in these processes, and the relationships between participation and equity.</p>",Rafi Santo; Sara Vogel; Jean Ryoo; Jill Denner; Camie Belgrave; Alicia Morris; Alex Tirado,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366969,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366969,0,https://drive.google.com/open?id=12wxZDhRbpAYASStkkviDpOfKt_TswFph

Special Session,Session 3H: Assignments that Blend Ethics and Technology,"<p>With the 2018 revision of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, there is a growing interest in how computer science faculty can integrate these principles into the education of future practitioners. This special session illustrates one approach by highlighting assignments that blend ethics and technology. These assignments can be used in a variety of courses, including CS1, CS2, and later courses. Presenters will provide an overview of each assignment and gather feedback from the audience. All materials, including descriptions, starter files, and guidelines for instructors, will be published at https://ethics.acm.org/SIGCSE2020.</p>",Stacy A.

Panel,Session 3I: Teaching TAs To Teach: Strategies for TA Training,"<p>""The only thing that scales with undergrads is undergrads"".
 
 As Computer Science course enrollments have grown, there has been a necessary increase in the number of undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants (TAs, and UTAs). TA duties often extend far beyond grading, including designing and leading lab or recitation sections, holding office hours and creating assignments. Though advanced students, TAs need proper pedagogical training to be the most effective in their roles. Training strategies have widely varied from no training at all, to semester-long prep courses. We will explore the challenges of TA training across both large and small departments. While much of the effort has focused on teams of undergraduates, most presenters have used the same tools and strategies with their graduate students. Training for TAs should not just include the mechanics of managing a classroom, but culturally relevant pedagogy. The panel will focus on the challenges of providing ""just in time"", and how we manage both intra-course training and department or campus led courses.

Panel,Session 3K: Integrating Computing and Computational Thinking into K-12 STEM Learning,"<p>Policymakers believe that preparing all students from the earliest grades to high school for a new future of STEM+Computing (STEM+C) integration involves teaching them not only the science and math central to these areas, but also how computational thinking is integral to STEM disciplines. This panel brings together four researchers who focus on research and development of interdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students. They will share the most impactful, practical, and promising approaches to STEM+C integration, their pros and cons, challenges, and key insights to successful STEM+C integration at all grade levels.</p>",Shuchi Grover; Kathryn Fisler; Irene Lee; Aman Yadav,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366970,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366970,,
Panel,Session 3L: Improving Global Participation in the SIGCSE Technical Symposium,"<p>SIGCSE is a global organization with members from well over one hundred countries, but attendance at SIGCSE conferences is not always reflective of membership as a whole. Attendance at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is overwhelmingly from the United States, with more than 92% of all attendees in recent years having a U.S. affiliation.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>This panel, which includes members of the SIGCSE Board and the Symposium International Committee, will present the state of Symposium participation from outside the U.S. in an effort towards understanding what can be done to expand global participation in the Symposium. The panelists span the range from students to long-time faculty and together have computing education experience from seven countries across six continents. The panel will also solicit views from attendees on barriers to global Symposium participation and ways to improve non-U.S. participation in SIGCSE's flagship conference.</p>",Amber Settle; Brett Becker; Rodrigo Duran; Viraj Kumar; Andrew Luxton-Reilly,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366979,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366979,0,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GKJrUUg6eisKMgqGZMym9v_ylIyHF5y4
Special Session,Session 4H: Activities for Building Understanding: How AI4ALL Teaches AI to Diverse High School Students,"<p>Aimed at people interested in how to teach artificial intelligence (AI) especially to a diverse audience of high schoolers, attendees of this special session will engage with activities excerpted directly from AI4ALL's Open Learning curriculum. AI4ALL Open Learning makes AI education free and approachable to groups that are otherwise excluded from the tech economy due to socioeconomic status, geographic location, access to resources, race, gender, and other factors. Content is delivered through an online learning management system. It is meant to be used in a blended learning environment, where students have in-person access to peers and facilitators, but can also be used by self-guided learners, who will interact with other learners through forums and other online tools. During this session, attendees will experience some of the activities provided in the curriculum. Attendees will leave with the materials required to run the activities in their own classrooms. Time will be provided for attendees to share how they would adapt the activities for use in their own classrooms and to provide feedback to AI4ALL.</p>",Sarah Judd,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366990,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366990,,

Panel,Session 4K: Panel: What and How to Teach Accessibility,"<p>This panel will provide practical advice on what and how to teach accessibility in a variety of settings. In this context, teaching accessibility means teaching about computer technologies that people with various disabilities can use and be productive with. At the undergraduate level it could mean teaching about how to design and build accessible web sites and applications. At the graduate level it could be teaching about building applications that can help people with disabilities with specific tasks. An entire course could focus on accessibility or it could be just part of an existing course. It is also important to learn about the diversity of consumers of technologies: what their abilities are and what access infrastructures they use every day. All the panelists have extensive experience in teaching accessibility. They will provide the audience of the panel deep insights into what they might do to teach accessibility in their own courses. </p>",Richard Ladner; Anat Caspi; Leah Findlater; Paula Gabbert; Amy J.

Special Session,Session 5H: An Introduction to Conducting Quantitative K-12 Computing Education Research,"<p>With the advent of computing education in primary and secondary schools, more research will be needed to determine the best way for students to learn how to think computationally and to design and develop software. As a field, computer science education researchers have been predominantly individuals who are steeped in content knowledge, but often have not had formal training in well-established educational research practices. Likewise, many also focus their research on undergraduate students in their own area of teaching. As the need for research into K-12 computing education grows, so does the opportunity for conducting quantitative studies in the field.</p>
<p>In this special session, the presenters will present a broad overview of how to conduct and evaluate quantitative computing education research. The presenters will spend approximately 15 minutes on each of the 4 key areas: designing a study, implementing a study and collecting data, analyzing and interpreting results, and reporting on the study. The remainder of the time will be as a question and answer period with the audience.</p>
<p>Since there is considerable overlap between computing education research at the primary/secondary and post-secondary levels, those new to research at the post-secondary level may also benefit from learning about form design, implementation, and reporting of research studies. Key takeaways for this session will include a basic understanding of K-12 computing education research from start to finish as well as a list of well-vetted resources to enable new researchers to explore and learn more.</p>",Monica M.

Special Session,Session 5I: IS2020: Updating the Information Systems Model Curriculum,"<p>The model curriculum used to develop, update, and assess IS programs (IS2010) is now nearly a decade old, and an assessment of the curriculum itself indicates that its value is decreasing due to the changing technological and skills demands in the information systems environment. Therefore, the ACM and AIS established an Exploratory Task Force that assessed IS2010 and recommended a taskforce be created to update the content and structure for a new model curriculum. One recurring theme is that current graduates' technical skills do not appear to meet industry needs. The IS discipline must express its core in terms of a standard curriculum to provide a foundation upon which to develop and offer undergraduate IS programs that meet stakeholder demands.
 
 A taskforce on the Information Systems Model Curriculum (IS2020) was created following the report and recommendation of the Exploratory Taskforce. This panel seeks to introduce the work of this taskforce as well as engage the IS education community in this effort. Panelists will introduce key components of this process and seek input and feedback. This session should be of interest to all attendees, especially faculty developing college-level curricula in Information Systems.

Panel,Session 5J: Computer Science through Concurrent Enrollment: A Strategy to Broaden Participation,"<p>Most U.S. states support college-readiness and access through dual enrollment, in which high school students enroll in college courses. Concurrent enrollment (CE) allows students to take college courses in their own high school, taught by high school teachers approved by the partner college. CE has positive effects on students' education, but rarely is CS available through CE. Unlike AP, CE provides college credit to students who are assessed throughout the course rather than by a single high-stakes exam/project. This panel will showcase four different types of post-secondary institutions' experiences offering CS-through-CE and discuss its potential as an entry point into CS for students underrepresented in computing, including those in urban and rural settings. Panelists will share challenges (such as teacher credentialing) and benefits of CS-through-CE. The audience will understand supports and barriers to creating CS-through-CE courses, will be provided with resources, and will crowd-source possible next steps in implementing CE as a model for broadening participation.</p>",Renee Fall; Seth Freeman; Ronald Greenberg; Daniel Kaiser; Nigamanth Sridhar,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366981,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366981,,
Panel,Session 5K: Extending and Evaluating the Use-Modify-Create Progression for Engaging Youth in Computational Thinking,"<p>The Use-Modify-Create progression (UMC) was conceptualized in 2011 after comparing the productive integration of computational thinking across National Science Foundation-funded Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (NSF ITEST) programs. Since that time, UMC has been widely promoted as a means to scaffold student learning of computational thinking (CT) while enabling personalization and allowing for creative adaptations of pre-existing computational artifacts. In addition to UMC's continued application, it has recently been utilized to scaffold student learning in topics as diverse as machine learning, e-textiles, and computer programming. UMC has also been applied to instructional goals other than ""supporting students in becoming creators of computational artifacts."" This panel will re-examine the UMC progression and refine our understanding of when its use is suitable, and when not, and share findings on evaluations and extensions to UMC that are productive in new and different contexts.</p>",Fred Martin; Irene Lee; Nicholas Lytle; Sue Sentance; Natalie Lao,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366971,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366971,,

Special Session,Session 6H: A Hands-On Tutorial on How To Incorporate Computing for Social Good in the Introductory Course Sequence,"<p>There are many excellent reasons for incorporating social good
 
 activities throughout our CS curricula. Possibly the most important
 
 are the large number of pressing local/global issues facing society
 
 (e.g. climate change and related issues)[7] which deserve the
 
 attention of the computing community, and in turn, demand the
 
 attention of computing educators. In addition, research suggests
 
 focusing on how computing can affect the social good can help
 
 broaden participation in computing[9, 10].
 
 The problem is many CS educators both don't know where to
 
 start or how to create programming assignments around socially
 
 relevant themes, and believe that such activities can only be undertaken
 
 by advanced students in upper division courses, e.g. software
 
 engineering and capstone courses. The purpose of this special session
 
 is to equip participants with the easy to learn skills so they can
 
 begin incorporating socially relevant assignments/projects throughout

More recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of NoSQL database systems, especially in data science. Bringing NoSQL databases to the classroom is important not only to prepare our students for the technology that they will face, but also because the underlying paradigm introduces new ideas that are not typically emphasized in a relational-only database course alone. However, NoSQL systems seem to receive dramatically less coverage in undergraduate database curricula than relational systems do. This panel discusses examples of how NoSQL can be introduced into undergraduate education, and the possible challenges faced in doing so.

Special Session,Session 7H: Teaching Practices Game: Interactive Resources for Training Teaching Assistants,"<p>In this interactive special session, participants will learn to facilitate a workshop for training teaching assistants (TAs) based on a card game. The game invites players to respond to challenging scenarios that TAs may face in the course of their duties. Each scenario appears on a card, and players discuss how they would respond. Session participants will receive a deck of 52 of these cards created with funding from a SIGCSE Special Projects Grant. This session uses the format of two previous well attended SIGCSE special sessions that focused on bias and had a target audience of faculty. While the intended audience is those interested in TA training, everyone interested in inclusive teaching practices is welcome to join in the rich small and large group discussions that we expect to take place!</p>",Colleen Lewis; Phillip Conrad,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366989,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366989,,
Special Session,Session 7I: Higher Education and Elementary School Computing Partnership,"<p>How to create a computer science partnership with an elementary school. The presenters discuss the various aspects and challenges of implementing a computer science program at the elementary school level, K-5. Topics to be discussed include where K-5 is now in Georgia, existing programs, curriculum development, pedagogy, funding, infrastructure, teacher training, and involvement of undergraduate computer science students. Audience members will be engaged throughout the presentation with questions and polls during and between topic discussions. The attendees may use their cellphones or laptops to respond to questions. The partnership group will converse about their experiences with diversity and geographic equity in computing. We believe any attendee wishing to do outreach or develop a computer science program at the K-5 level will be interested.</p>",Mary Hudachek-Buswell; Cedric Stallworth; LeAnne Cheatham; Faith North; Ruchi Banerjee,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366991,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366991,,
Panel,Session 7J: Supporting Students from Underrepresented Groups to Succeed in Computing: Research and Programs in Community College,"<p>There are over 1,000 community colleges (CC) in the U.S.; they enroll more than 13 million students--nearly half of all undergraduates-- and over half of CC students are non-white (American Association of Community Colleges). However, efforts to broaden participation in computing have been directed disproportionately to 4-year institutions. The focus of this panel is on research and strategies for increasing the retention of students from groups that are underrepresented in computing--female, Latinx, and African American students. It includes experts from across the US--from CC's and a research organization. The panelists will describe curriculum and programs that are designed to support students, and include the perspectives of students on what helps and hinders them from persisting. The intended audience for this panel is researchers, educators, and administrators from both community colleges and 4-year institutions.</p>",Debra Richardson; Amardeep Kahlon; Cheryl Calhoun; Shannon Campe,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366983,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366983,,
Panel,Session 7K: National CS Ed Equity-Focused Consortia and Their Value to the Community,"<p>The Computer Science education community is supported by numerous national-focused consortia dedicated to addressing persistent inequalities in student pathways. This panel, comprised of leaders from four of those consortia (CAHSI, STARS, ECEP and RPPforCS) will use four key aspects of improvement communities as a framework for discussing the role, potential and impact of these consortia in supporting the equitable growth of computer science education. While not designed to be Network Improvement Communities per se, we draw upon those frameworks to focus on four specific aspects: 1) guided by shared goals with attention to equity; 2) engaging community in deep understanding of the problems and associated systems; 3) application of improvement science; and 4) coordinated efforts of shared learning and measurements. Th</p>

Panel,Session 7L: Looking Ahead: Professional Development Needs for Experienced CS Teachers,"<p>As computer science is moving into K-12 education, most efforts have focused on getting new teachers into computer science or integrating computing within STEM topics. But one aspect that has received less attention, if any, is the continued professional development of experienced CS teachers. We know little about the particular learning needs of experienced CS teachers, knowledge that will be critical as the CS teaching force expands significantly in coming years. In this panel, we address this knowledge gap from the perspective of teacher education research and professional development-what we need to know about deepening teachers' pedagogical practices and content knowledge-an understanding that will be instrumental for retaining and enriching teachers in CS education.</p>",Yasmin kafai; Jake Baskin; Deborah Fields; Joanna Goode; Bryan “BT” Twarek; Aman Yadav,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366977,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366977,,
Special Session,Session 8H: Perspectives on Allyship in Academia,"<p>Allyship in academia is critical for creating inclusive communities that are welcoming to all students, but the perception of its benefits and challenges can vary depending on a number of factors. This session will explore perspectives of allyship in academia by bringing together a diverse group of faculty and students who can share a wide range of experiences and insights, and aims to facilitate a discussion among all attendees that leads to an exchange of ideas, the strengthening of our community, and progress toward our common goal of inclusion in computing. </p>",Jamie Payton; Adam Blank; Christian Murphy; Melissa Hovik; Kevin Lin; Angela Kwon; Lara McConnaughey,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366997,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366997,,
Panel,Session 8I: CS Principles Curriculum Framework Updates for 2020,"<p>In 2017 the Advanced Placement CS Principles course had the most successful launch of any AP course in history. In its first three years more than 220,000 students have sat for the exam and the course has successfully increased participation among women and other traditionally underrepresented groups in AP computer science. Like any breadth-first CS course the AP CSP curriculum requires regular updating and in this panel we will discuss changes coming for the 2020 academic year. We will share perspectives from the College Board and higher education faculty with the goal of providing audience members a better understanding of the nature of the course's first round of updates and the motivation behind them.</p>",Crystal Furman; Adam Cannon; Elizabeth Johnson; Paul Tymann,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366985,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366985,,
Panel,Session 8J: Industry and Academic Collaboration: Google Faculty in Residence Experiences,"<p>Experiences from the Google Faculty in Residence Program are presented as a unique, productive example of an industry driven academic collaboration emphasizing project-based learning [2]. Representative faculty participants describe their experiences and their unique projects developed during Google Faculty in Residence (FIR) where faculty worked together with experienced Google developers. Part of FIR included training from Google developers on a wide range of software engineering best practices, student preparation for industry and computer science recruitment and retention. Consideration of diversity and inclusivity in students backgrounds and preparedness were tantamount in project goals. Projects developed targeted both lower and upper division curriculum and in some cases pedagogy outside of traditional classroom boundaries. Results of the application of projects at panelists institutions are given.</p>",Lynne Grewe; Kathy Kanemoto; Susan Wang; Jaye Espy,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366984,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366984,,
Panel,"Session 8K: Minoritized Students' Engagement, Identity, and Agency in Computer Science: Listening to the Students Themselves","<p>This panel focuses on the voices of computer science (CS) high school students who come from communities historically underrepresented in CS. Our UCLA team worked in research-practice partnership with teachers and students from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to understand how youth engagement, agency, and identity are being impacted, if at all, by efforts to broaden participation in computing. Going beyond a ""numbers"" approach, we define equity as attending to the cultural wealth, funds of knowledge, and perspectives youth bring to their CS learning experiences, amplifying minoritized youth's visions of what CS education should be in the CS for All movement. This panel begins by sharing findings from our year-long qualitative study in four CS classrooms, followed by hearing from the students themselves about what impacts their motivation to learn CS. Student panelists will explain how and why they choose to engage in CS learning toward empowering themselves and their communities, as well as how they are developing CS identities. Together, we will explore what it takes for youth to acquire a sense of ""rightful presence"" [1] in a field dominated by people who do not look like them or come from their communities.</p>",Jean Ryoo; Jane Margolis; Tiera Tanksley; Cynthia Estrada; Alicia Morris; LAUSD Students,Session,10.1145/3328778.3366972,https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366972,https://youtu.be/BNet950-8d8,0
