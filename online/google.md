## Sessions

### How Google Supports and Uses CS Education Research

**Presenters:** Chris Stephenson, Sepi Moghadam, Kyle Jennings, Sloan Davis

**Abstract:**

Unlike other disciplines, computer science (CS) does not have an extensive body of rigorous research to enable data-based decisions about how CS is best taught and learned. With post-secondary CS programs operating beyond capacity, and many states mandating CS for all K-12 students, this lack of knowledge is seriously impinging on our capacity to best serve an increasing number of students. In addition, our postsecondary researcher pipeline continues to demonstrate the lack of diversity common to all aspects of the discipline. This session focuses on the ways in which Google is both supporting and using research. Attendees will learn about several programs that provide funding and opportunities to improve teaching and learning and diversify the research pipeline. They will also gain insight into how Google navigates the challenges of using research to improve program efficacy.

### How Ubiquitous, On-demand Computing Is Changing Scientific Data Analysis

**Presenters:** Lak Lakshmanan

**Abstract:**

Cloud computing is evolving, from rented infrastructure ("infrastructure as a service") to fully managed services ("platform as a service") that enable the creation of complete workflows in the cloud ("software as a service"). This trend has huge implications for how science and scientific analysis is carried out. For example, cheap, connected sensors ("internet of things") and auto-scaled data analysis open up streaming data analysis and adaptive sensors. In addition, the data that is collected as a result can be analyzed at scale, and much of the data analysis automated due to the increasing ability of machine learning services to understand the unstructured data. This session will highlight resources that will behlp attendees learn more about this exciting field.

## Demos

### Demo 1: Resources for Teaching Google Cloud

[Online Resources](https://bit.ly/gcoSIGCSEdemo1)

### Demo 2: Cloud Based Notebooks as a Teaching Tool

If you'd like to use Jupyter-style notebooks in your class without managing your own server, take a look at Colab which provides "a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources including GPUs. For more information, visit our FAQ at [https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

### Demo 13: CSforED: Teacher Preparation for CS Education

**Description:** Teacher preparation programs across the US are becoming aware of the need for CS education to be a part of teacher programs. In this study we explore the existing CS education integration into teacher preparation programs primarily in schools of education. In addition to findings regarding education coursework, we offer opportunities for CS departments to partner on this important work."
