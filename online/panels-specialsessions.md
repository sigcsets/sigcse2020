### ABET Computing Program Accreditation: Recent Changes and Lessons Learned

**Presenters:** David Gibson, Michael Oudshoorn

**Abstract:**

The speakers will describe ABET's recently revised criteria for computing programs including computer science, information technology, information science, and cybersecurity. ABET made significant changes to the curriculum and student outcomes criteria for computing programs in 2018 based on new and updated guidelines from professional computing organizations such as the ACM. The speakers will discuss lessons learned from evaluating computing programs under the revised criteria in 2018 and 2019 including the first programs accredited under the new cybersecurity program criteria. They will also introduce ABET's draft associate cybersecurity program criteria recently developed for 2-year cybersecurity programs. This session will be of particular interest to computing programs considering initial ABET accreditation or seeking reaccreditation in the next few years.

### Codio: Building Scaleable Solutions to Address the Challenges of the Community

**Presenters:** Elise Deitrick

**Abstract:**

Codio shares the findings of their 2019 Computer Science Educator survey which illuminated the most challenging aspects of teaching CS today. Combining these practitioner concerns with best practices from research, Codio introduces their (1) fully auto-graded, feedback-rich assessments library, (2) conceptualization of digital content, and (3) learning insights that visualize data across content and students.

### Fighting Inertia - Getting from 0% to North of 50%

**Presenters:** Steve Bitner (University of West Florida)

**Abstract:**

Sometimes it is difficult to promote the usage of modern software practices in your department as well as your classroom.

We will discuss the steps that Steve Bitner, GitHub Campus Advisor, has taken with in the Department of Computer Science to promote the use of GitHub and other modern software practices. Take examples on how to convince your colleagues to embrace modern tools and practices. We will also discuss how Dominic Letarte, GitHub Campus Advisor, assigns team work when students have heterogeneous experience levels. The talk with discuss with simple examples, on how to scaffold simple team member interactions using GitHub Classroom, issues, pull requests, commit logs and the use of a project board.

### Google: How Google Supports and Uses CS Education Research

**Presenters:** Chris Stephenson, Sepi Moghadam, Kyle Jennings, Sloan Davis

**Abstract:**

Unlike other disciplines, computer science (CS) does not have an extensive body of rigorous research to enable data-based decisions about how CS is best taught and learned. With post-secondary CS programs operating beyond capacity, and many states mandating CS for all K-12 students, this lack of knowledge is seriously impinging on our capacity to best serve an increasing number of students. In addition, our postsecondary researcher pipeline continues to demonstrate the lack of diversity common to all aspects of the discipline. This session focuses on the ways in which Google is both supporting and using research. Attendees will learn about several programs that provide funding and opportunities to improve teaching and learning and diversify the research pipeline. They will also gain insight into how Google navigates the challenges of using research to improve program efficacy.

### Google: How Ubiquitous, On-demand Computing Is Changing Scientific Data Analysis

**Presenters:** Lak Lakshmanan

**Abstract:**

Cloud computing is evolving, from rented infrastructure ("infrastructure as a service") to fully managed services ("platform as a service") that enable the creation of complete workflows in the cloud ("software as a service"). This trend has huge implications for how science and scientific analysis is carried out. For example, cheap, connected sensors ("internet of things") and auto-scaled data analysis open up streaming data analysis and adaptive sensors. In addition, the data that is collected as a result can be analyzed at scale, and much of the data analysis automated due to the increasing ability of machine learning services to understand the unstructured data. This session will highlight resources that will behlp attendees learn more about this exciting field.
