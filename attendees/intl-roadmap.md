The following sessions and events my be of interest to non-US attendees. Sessions and events specifically targeted at, involving, or in some cases presented by international attendees have been highlighted. There are many other aspects of diversity that are not included but may be of interest - again, all of these we feel may be particularly interesting for attendees coming from outside the United States. Be sure to check out the full symposium schedule [here](https://whova.com/embedded/event/sigcs_202003/?utc_soruce=ems).

Some events/sessions require pre-registration (normally during conference registration online). However it is possible (up to a certain date) to modify your registration to include these events depending on availability. 

If you have questions, feel free to contact Brett Becker, the International Liaison (brett.becker@ucd.ie).

## Pre-Symposium

[Wednesday, March 11](https://whova.com/embedded/event/sigcs_202003/?utc_soruce=ems#tab011)

[Computing for Social Good in Education](https://whova.com/embedded/session/sigcs_202003/834754/?view=)

> 8:30am - 5:00pm, Mar 11, B110 **(Prior registeration required from [this page](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/SIGCSE_2020_POSSE_Roundup))** 

> Computing for Social Good in Education (CSG-Ed) provides an opportunity for learning technical and professional skills while reinforcing computing's social relevance. This FREE SIGCAS-sponsored pre-symposium event will allow participants to learn how to incorporate CSG-Ed into their classroom in two ways. 

> Gregory Hislop (Drexel University), Mikey Goldweber (Xavier University), Heidi J. C. Ellis (Western New England University), Lori Postner (Nassau Community College), Lisa Kaczmarczyk (Lisa Kaczmarczyk PhD Consulting, LLC), Grant Braught (Dickinson College), Richard Blumenthal (Regis University), Herman Jackson (Western New England University), Darci Burdge (Nassau Community College), Karl Wurst (Worcester State University)


[Workshop #107: Leading Conversations about Microaggressions, Bias, and Other Difficult Topics](https://whova.com/embedded/subsession/sigcs_202003/834375/834382/?view=)

> 7:00pm - 10:00pm, Mar 11, B115 **(Prior registration required via SIGCSE registration portal at [sigcse2020.sigcse.org](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/))**

> Have you ever frozen - not knowing what to say - when you heard a comment or question about diversity? Do you want to learn to facilitate an activity that can help you and your colleagues practice responding to bias? Join us!

> We will play a research-based game to practice recognizing and responding to bias. The game invites players to respond to challenging scenarios related to subtle bias. Each scenario appears on a card, and players discuss how they would respond. You'll get to play the game and learn about strategies for sharing the game with a few faculty, your students, or in a larger workshop. Bringing these skills back to your colleagues is an important way to disseminate and scale strategies for creating more inclusive CS classrooms. There are no prerequisites for this workshop and attendees will receive copies of the game to continue to learn and share with others.

> Participants do not need any equipment.

> Colleen Lewis (Harvey Mudd College), Catherine Ashcraft & Wendy M. DuBow (University of Colorado Boulder), Helen Hu (Westminster College, Utah), Kyla McMullen (University of Florida)
