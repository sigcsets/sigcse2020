## Paper Session Chair Guidelines

Each session consists of three 25-minute paper presentations.  Each presentation is expected to last up to 20 minutes with 5 minutes for questions.

### Session Chair Responsibilities

Session chairs should complete the following tasks:

* At the speaker breakfast, introduce yourself and confirm the following:
   * pronunciation of speaker name(s)
   * speaker's affiliation(s)
   * speaker's title(s)
   * speaker's pronouns
   * if the speaker is a student who will be graduating soon
* Before the session starts, have speakers check equipment and send your assigned student volunteer for help if needed.
* When speaking to the session, always use a microphone!
* Start the session on time by introducing yourself and the entire session. 
* Introduce each speaker using their proper name. Ensure that introductions are consistent for all speakers in the sessions using common titles and language.
* Keep time and provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the start of the 5-minute question and answer period.
* When the speakers is done, say "Let's thank our speaker" and applaud.
* Twenty-five minutes is a hard stop.  When time is up, stand up, thank the speaker, and applaud up the next speaker.
* Have the next speaker start to set up about 1 minute before question time is done to ensure a smooth transition.
* If you need to cut of a questioner or discussion, suggest that the discussion resumes after the session is over.
* Cut off any questions that are belligerent or insulting.  Please let the Program or General Chairs know about the issue.
* If a speaker is absent or if a speaker finishes before their 25-minutes is over, do NOT start the next paper early! Attendees will time their attendance with the start times listed in the program.
* Come prepared with a question for each speaker! You can discuss this with your speakers over breakfast.
* At the end of the session, tell attendees what is next.
* Before leaving the session, sign off on the student volunteer form.

Many of these items are from [Emery Berger's blog post "A Guide for Session Chairs"](https://emeryblogger.com/2016/06/08/a-guide-for-session-chairs/), which provides more details about useful session chair information.

Thank you for chairing a session at SIGCSE 2020!
