## March 2 Update: SIGCSE 2020 Will Continue as Planned

First, we would like to thank all of you for your patience while we work through this challenging situation.  We know what the Technical Symposium means to our community and we want to make certain that we are considering all of our options and the associated consequences.  Please know that the leadership team has been in constant communication with the SIGCSE board, the ACM, representatives from Portland, and our planning company for several days as the situation in the US has evolved.

**As of March 2, the decision is to continue with SIGCSE 2020 as planned.**

In our deliberations, we looked at the risk assessment from the CDC, guidance from the ACM, advice from our planning company, and what was going on currently in Portland, at the Oregon Convention Center, and with other large conferences and events.  After serious consideration of all available information we have and in consultation with our partners, we believe that the Technical Symposium can go forward as planned with low risk to our attendees.  

### SIGCSE 2020 Refund Policy (Updated)
We understand and respect that there will be a portion of our community that will not feel comfortable participating in SIGCSE 2020.  It is our desire to be as accommodating as possible to those who do not feel that they can attend for whatever reason, whether it is based on government or employer restrictions, your own health if you are not feeling well, or personal choice.  However, we also have to acknowledge that at this point, we have made financial obligations that we are contractually required to fulfill.  To that end, our policy regarding refunds is as follows:

- The conference refund policy ([https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/attendees/#registration](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/attendees/#registration) - a refund with $100 processing fee) will be extended through Tuesday, March 10, at 11:59 PM PDT.  To process your cancellation, please email [registration@sigcse2020.org](registration@sigcse2020.org) with the subject line “Cancellation request.”

- Individuals who are explicitly banned from attending because of official government travel bans will be issued full refunds by request to [registration@sigcse2020.org](registration@sigcse2020.org) with the subject line “Government Travel Restriction.”  Requests must be received by Tuesday, March 10, at 11:59 PM PDT.

If you have already canceled through Cvent, we will retroactively work through the system to issue a refund, per the policy above.  Please allow us sufficient time to identify these individuals and process the refund.

### SIGCSE 2020 Presentation Policy
We will continue to follow our posted policy about presenter substitutions and no-shows ([https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/attendees/policies.html](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/attendees/policies.html)) with one exception for paper presenters, discussed below.

If you are a presenting author and decide not to attend SIGCSE 2020, please connect with your co-authors or work with attending colleagues to find someone to cover your presentation. 

Please let [program@sigcse2020.org](mailto:program@sigcse2020.org) know of any program updates or if a presentation should be canceled. We would appreciate notification by Tuesday, March 10, at 11:59 PM PDT.  In your email please include your presentation title, cc co-authors/presenters, and if there’s a substitute, please cc the substitute so we can verify the substitution.  

*For Paper Presenters:* If you are the presenting author of a paper and there are no substitutes, we will welcome a 20-minute video presentation.  The presentation must be posted in a location where the Program Chairs and Session Chairs can download it and run it from their laptop - we will be unable to stream presentations.  Please email video links to [program@sigcse2020.org](mailto:program@sigcse2020.org) and ensure we can download the video, not simply play it from the link.

Due to logistical challenges, we will be unable to make these videos public or to live stream other parts of the Technical Symposium.  We will, however, be recording the keynote speakers and will make those videos available after the conference. 

### Information for Attendees
For those still coming to Portland, we will be taking additional steps to help protect the health of those at the Technical Symposium:

- We’re instituting a “no handshake rule,” with attendees encouraged to be creative (elbow bumps, bows, hand-on-heart gestures, etc.).
- Extra hand sanitizing stations will be available throughout the Oregon Convention Center.  We encourage attendees to bring your own sanitation supplies.
- We encourage attendees to bring your own water bottle to refill throughout the week.
- As always, there will be an EMT on-site if you feel ill.

Again, we thank you for your patience during this time and your understanding as we work through this challenging situation.  If anything changes, we will inform everyone as soon as possible.  Otherwise, we will plan to send an update at the end of the week regardless.

We hope to see many of you in Portland next week.  And we look forward to seeing the entire community back together at SIGCSE 2021 in Toronto.


### Portland Statement (March 3)

"The Oregon Health Authority, the City of Portland and Travel Portland are all closely monitoring the situation in our community. Portland is currently open for business, and travel is not restricted. According to authorities, the risk of exposure in Portland is still low. That said, things could change, and it is impossible to predict how the situation will unfold in the future. Because of this, we are relying on public health officials to provide the best information and guidance.

The Oregon Health Authority provides daily updates of the situation in Oregon <[https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx)>, and you can monitor developments at the national level by visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website for COVID-19<[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)>.

At this time, the Multnomah County<[https://multco.us/health-officer/novel-coronavirus-covid-19](https://multco.us/health-officer/novel-coronavirus-covid-19)> and state health authorities are prioritizing healthy work and travel habits around hygiene and have not advised on any other level of guidance at this point. The CDC is simply encouraging individuals to take the same routine precautions as for the flu:

  *   Avoid contact with sick people.
  *   Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
  *   Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol.
      *   Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
      *   It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.

As the situation changes, the CDC will provide updated information and revised guidance, if necessary.

As to SIGCSE 2020 specifically, we will continue to monitor developments and keep you informed of response locally so you can make the best decisions moving forward. The health and safety of your presenters and delegates is our top priority, and we will follow all guidance from local, state and national public health officials. At this time, the local response is encouraging individuals to follow the CDC recommendations listed above.

Travel Portland will be sure to provide relevant updates in as close to real time as possible, The resources shared above and below will utilize real-time updates.
