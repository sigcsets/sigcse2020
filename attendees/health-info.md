## SIGCSE 2020's Statement on COVID-19: SIGCSE is still on

The Technical Symposium leadership team and the SIGCSE board want to inform you of our considerations and preparations for SIGCSE 2020 with regards to the current world attention on the COVID-19 virus. Our hearts go out to our members and friends, their families, and their communities that have been affected by this outbreak and we are committed to helping as we can.

Please know that we are working closely with our event planning company and representatives from Portland’s Convention and Visitors Bureau, Travel Portland, to stay informed about the potential risk in the Portland area.  We are closely monitoring communications from the CDC and industry channels.  Should the risk level change, we will follow the CDC recommendations and inform our attendees immediately.   

**As of this statement on February 28, the Technical Symposium will take place as planned.**

The vast majority of our attendees are coming from the United States, Canada, and Europe.  We have had some attendees from affected countries cancel their registration due to government travel restrictions and we are working with them on alternate presentation options for their accepted submissions to the Technical Symposium.  We will continue to reach out to individuals from affected countries in the days ahead.  

To our community members that are currently in the United States or from any other country that has not seen any significant activity from the COVID-19 virus, we understand that traveling during this time can still be an anxious experience.  If you feel you cannot travel to Portland, contact us at <a href="mailto:covid-response@sigcse2020.org">covid-response@sigcse2020.org</a> and we can discuss your concerns and options.

### CDC Information as of February 28, 2020

Per the CDC’s current information and recommendations on COVID-19: 

*Imported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S. Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 also has been reported among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan. On February 25, CDC confirmed COVID-19 in a person who reportedly did not have relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient with COVID-19 (unknown exposure). At this time, this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.*

*For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.

“The Oregon Health Authority, city of Portland and Travel Portland like the rest of the world is monitoring the spread of the COVID-19 closely. At this time, there is no cause for concern of exposure to the virus in the city and the best precautions taken are on the individual level.
 
The Center for Disease Control encourages individuals:

* Avoid contact with sick people.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
* Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
* It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.

It should be noted these are the same recommendations the CDC makes during flu season. As of Feb. 25, the CDC had confirmed the virus is not circulating in the U.S. You can monitor developments at the national level by visiting the CDC’s website for COVID-19 ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)).
 
The Oregon Health Authority has been monitoring citizens who have been in regions where outbreaks have occurred. As of Feb. 24, 76 people were being monitored. No one was currently under investigation as of Feb. 24. Only two people have been under investigation since the outbreak and both tested negative for the virus and have been released. Weekly updates of the situation in Oregon can be monitored [here](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx). 

Travel Portland understands the concern you may have regarding the illness especially considering recent news coverage. Our industry partners share our concerns for the health and safety of visitors and will continue to monitor developments as they occur.”
