**Rules While at SIGCSE**

1. No handshakes.  No hugs.  We invite you to be creative with your greetings this week. 
2. Wash your hands.  Use hand sanitizer.  Especially around food, like at the Thursday reception and at the break tables.  The CDC recommends a solid 20 seconds with soap and warm water, getting the backs of your hands and under the nails.  
3. If you feel ill when you wake up one morning, stay in your room and contact the leadership team.  If you are out and about at the OCC and you don’t feel well, head straight to the EMT.  

**Feeling Ill?**

The med-tech / EMT can be found in the station closest to Exhibit Hall E. They are also mobile and accessible via radio. So if there is an issue, find a member of the leadership team or ask at the registration desk.

See [https://www.oregoncc.org/en/attend/maps](https://www.oregoncc.org/en/attend/maps) and click "First Aid Stations" on the left side menu for the location.

The nearest urgent care facility is across the street from the Oregon Convention Center:

ZOOM+Care Super    
607 NE Grand Ave    
Portland, OR 97232

**Nursing Pods**

The mamava pods are located near Exhibit Hall E and then another near Exhbit Hall A. There is an app that attendees can download that allows access to the pod (some mother’s will already have this on their phones). Or, it can also be access via a code. Email [symposium@sigcse2020.org](mailto:symposium@sigcse2020.org) for the code or ask at the registration desk.
