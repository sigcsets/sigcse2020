### Cancellation Policy

Cancellation requests must be made by {{page.cancellation_date}}.

A processing fee of US$100 will be assessed. Regrettably cancellations received after the cancellation date cannot be honored. The conference committee recognizes that sometimes last-minute cancellations can't be avoided due to weather, travel disruptions, and/or health issues. However, the conference incurs expenses for which it is liable based on registration counts. Registrants are strongly advised to purchase travel insurance to cover their non-refundable expenses. Also, registrants who find themselves unable to attend should be aware that registrations are transferable, but in general the conference committee cannot assist in finding an appropriate recipient.



<hr/>


### Regarding Visas

ACM is able to provide visa support letters to attendees as well as authors with accepted papers, posters, or members of the conference committee.

For Visa support letters, please email all requests to the Office of SIG Services at [supportletters@acm.org](mailto:supportletters@acm.org).  The information below should be included with the request:

* Name and mailing address as it appears on your passport.
* The name of the conference you wish to attend.
* Registration confirmation number.
* If you are the author of any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title.
* Fax number and/or e-mail address of where the invitation letter should be sent.

Those requesting a letter should allow 7-10 business days to receive it. All requests are handled in the order they are received.
