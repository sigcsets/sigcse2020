## SIGCSE @ Portland, OR

The city of <a href="https://micro.travelportland.com/sigcse/" target="_blank">Portland has put together a microsite</a> just for us! Lots of good info there, and definitely something you should check out. Transport, dining, excursions,... all the info you want, and (most importantly) accurate and from the source!

More details will be coming as we get closer to SIGCSE 2020!
