With the theme of SIGCSE 2020 being "A Vision for the Next 50 Years," the Symposium organizers want to provide space for various affinity groups to meet to discuss issues that are important to them in guiding our community forward.  Think of these as "informal Birds-of-a-Feather sessions."

During the lunch break on Friday, March 13, certain session rooms at the Oregon Convention Center will be made available to these affinity groups.  Interested persons are encouraged to purchase lunch at one of the dining options at the OCC or nearby and bring their food back to these rooms for their discussion.  Attendees can use the messaging and bulletin board features in Whova to organize further if they so choose.  While this could simply be a time for affinity groups to mingle and catch up, if there are ideas or action items that come out of these lunches, Symposium leadership and SIGCSE Board members will be available to hear what you have to say!

For this year, we are initially assigning rooms to affinity groups based upon the NSF Broadening Participation categories.

The first set of groups for SIGCSE 2020 are: African American, Hispanic, LGBTQ, Native American, and Women.

If there is another group that would like to meet, please email [affinity@sigcse2020.org](mailto:affinity@sigcse2020.org) and we will do our best to accommodate you.  We can handle around six more groups this year.  We would like to continue doing this every year in the future, so please also let us know your thoughts on how we could handle this event going forward.

More information about the Affinity Group meetups can be found in Whova.
