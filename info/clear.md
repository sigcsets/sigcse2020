### Selected Insights Gathered for Computer Science Educators

A Lifetime Service award suggests many years of being involved in Computer Science Education. Over these years I have gained numerous active caring insights to promote support and guide Computer Science Educators. Being a successful CS educator does not just involve gaining a qualification and teaching classes. There are so many exciting and rewarding aspects to this career that enhance the classroom experience for all and also add to the promotion and excitement of the discipline.
These insights are gathered from over 40 years of teaching and supervising students, 25 years as a Chair of  Department  and some exciting and innovative research projects. From  the  villages in the high Andes to local diversity issues, from coding  in binary and hex to apps on smart phones the revolution of the digital age has been a major part of my journey in computer science education.
