### Changing the Landscape of Computing: A Vision for the Next 25 Years

According to the U.S. Census, the United States of America will become a majority-minority country by 2045. As the U.S. experiences this demographic shift, what will happen to computer science? Will our discipline become more inclusive? What shifts will occur in computer science? Computer science does not have a good record addressing its diversity challenges. A simple Google search for "Silicon Valley's Diversity Problem", really makes this clear. Further exploration into data from the Computing Research Association (CRA), shows how underrepresented minority groups are in computing at the Bachelor, Master, Doctoral, and faculty levels. Can computer science improve its diversity during the demographic shift? Dr. Gilbert believe it is possible to change the demographics in computer science, but it will require a cultural shift in computing along with institutional change, starting with computer science education.
