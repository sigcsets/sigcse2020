### A Top-Ten List for 50-50

SIGCSE addresses gender issues in computing year after year.  At DePauw University, we learned from SIGCSE's lessons – and those taught by ACM's Council on Women in Computing – and recently awarded 47% of our computer science undergraduate degrees to women.  This talk provides a rapid-fire countdown of ten of our most effective strategies that created our 47% class. -->

### Bio
Valerie Taylor is the director of the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.

Dr. Taylor held multiple leadership roles at Texas A&M University, prior to joining Argonne. Most recently, she served as the senior associate dean of academic affairs in the College of Engineering, a Regents Professor and the Royce E. Wisenbaker Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Prior to that, she served as head of Computer Science and Engineering from 2003 to 2011. Before she joined Texas A&M, Dr. Taylor was a faculty member in Northwestern University’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department for eleven years.

Dr. Taylor has authored or coauthored more than 100 papers on high performance computing. She has developed and used models to analyze and improve the performance of many parallel, scientific applications, including finite element applications, molecular dynamics, cosmology, earthquake simulations, ocean modeling, and magnetic fusion.

Dr. Taylor is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and of the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM). She has received numerous awards for distinguished research and leadership, including the 2001 IEEE Harriet B. Rigas Award for significant contributions in engineering education; the 2002 Outstanding Young Engineering Alumni Award from the University of California at Berkeley; the 2002 A. Nico Habermann Award for increasing diversity in computing; and the 2005 Tapia Achievement Award for Scientific Scholarship, Civic Science, and Diversifying Computing. Dr. Taylor is also the executive director of the Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in Information Technology (CMD-IT).
Dr. Taylor earned her bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering and master’s degree in computer engineering from Purdue University in 1985 and 1986, respectively. She received her PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1991.
