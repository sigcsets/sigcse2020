<p> The Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education of the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM SIGCSE) is a community of approximately 2,600 people whom, in addition to their specialization within computing,
have a strong interest in the quality of computing education. The SIGCSE Symposium is the flagship conference of the
organization and is regularly attended by more than 1,500 people. Conference attendees are looking for new ideas,
textbooks to support their courses, and materials to improve the effectiveness of their teaching. Course related software
and hardware systems are of great interest. With increased pressure to pursue distance learning and asynchronous
learning, attendees will want to find out about the latest innovations in web authoring tools and class management systems.</p>
<p>
In addition to selecting the textbooks and support
materials for their courses, conference attendees
influence the choice of computing equipment for their
laboratories as well as for their departments. They select
the tools that support teaching and their own scholarly
work. They also determine what languages will be used
in their courses and what compilers and development
environments will be installed. These professionals set
aside the time of the Symposium to review what is
available and make their choices for the coming years.
This is the most efficient way to interact with the most active
teaching faculty in computing and information science.
