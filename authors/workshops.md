## What is a Workshop?

Workshops provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest. A successful workshop should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful in the classroom. To this end, workshop presenters should provide participants with handouts outlining the workshop material.

SIGCSE will provide one night free lodging per accepted workshop (not per presenter) at one of the conference hotels. This will be arranged after the accepted workshops have been selected. Please discuss this with your co-presenters and decide who will be using the provided free night.
 
## Review Criteria and Process

**Reviews are not blind.** Proposals are evaluated for relevance, anticipated interest, quality, and availability of appropriate facilities. Additionally, the breadth of topics is considered with the aim of having a balanced program. Finally, for workshops that have run before, feedback from prior workshops may be taken into account. You may want to review the list of last year’s accepted SIGCSE Technical Symposium workshops prior to submitting a proposal.

The proposal has two parts: the full proposal and the EasyChair submission, both of which are discussed in more detail below. 


## Full Proposal Content

The full proposal is used only for the review process.The proposal length is {{site.data.cfp.details["Workshops"].limits}} maximum. The required content is as follows.

-   **Title**: A title for the Workshop.

-   **Proposer**: Name, affiliation, email address, and website address of the presenter who will serve as the corresponding author.

-   **Other Presenter(s)**: Names and affiliations of any presenters other than the proposer. All presenters must register for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium and be present for the workshop session, so be certain that you have their commitments before listing them.

-   **Abstract**: An accurate and publishable description of the workshop. Include information about the intended audience to help readers make an informed choice about attending your proposed workshop. URLs are permitted, and abstracts of accepted workshops can be edited in response to reviews. 

-   **Significance and Relevance of the Topic**: Used by reviewers to assess the significance of the topic. Include information about any trends in relation to the topic and possibly describe (or cite) evidence to that effect.

-   **Participant Computer Requirements**: Used by attendees and by reviewers to assess the quality of the proposed workshop. For hands-on workshops, indicate Laptop Required, Laptop Recommended, or Laptop Optional (see “Hands-on Lab-based Workshops” below) and which operating systems are supported (Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS). Describe any special requirements for attendees’ computers. 

-   **Rough Agenda for the Workshop**: Used by reviewers to assess the quality of the proposed workshop. Workshops are three hours long with a 15-minute break that includes refreshments. Explain how you will budget the time, including a realistic amount for attendee questions. Be flexible with respect to the timing of the break, since that must be coordinated with the venue and the other workshops.

-   **Expertise of Presenter(s)**: Used by reviewers to assess the quality of the proposed workshop. Summarize the qualifications of the presenter(s) as they relate to the proposed topic.

-	**Advertisement:** Used to attract possible attendees. Because it is not published in the Symposium proceedings, the advertisement can use less formal language or include details that are not appropriate for the abstract.

-   **Expected Audience**: Used by reviewers to gauge the level of interest Symposium attendees would have in the proposed workshop. Describe the anticipated nature and size of the audience. 

-   **Space and Enrollment Restrictions**: Used by Symposium organizers to assess availability of appropriate facilities and to manage registration and room assignments. Provide the maximum number of participants that you can accommodate. If no limit is specified, we will assume a cap of 30 participants, although if interest is strong, we may seek to raise the limit to 40 or more. Also indicate any special restrictions on the non-A/V configuration of the room (e.g. round tables to facilitate discussion, clear floor space for robots).


-   **Audio/Visual Requirements**: Used by Symposium organizers to assess availability of appropriate facilities and to manage A/V equipment. Indicate requirements such as wireless access, wired access, extra power outlets, microphone, digital projector, overhead projector, flip charts and pens, whiteboards, etc. Standard A/V materials and equipment (to be specified at the time of acceptance notifications) will be available for all workshops. In order to cover the costs associated with non-standard items, the minimum number of registrants for a workshop requiring such items may need to be raised.  

-   **Other Critical Information**: Used by reviewers to assess relevance, anticipated interest, and quality of proposed workshop. Include any other notes that will facilitate such assessment.

### What gets published and where?

If the proposal is accepted, the presenter name(s) and affiliation(s), the workshop title, and the abstract as entered in EasyChair appear on the SIGCSE Technical Symposium website, in the printed program, and in the proceedings. The advertisement as entered in EasyChair also appears on the website.

## Hands-On Lab-Based Workshops

Some SIGCSE Technical Symposium workshops are "hands-on," i.e., participants use their laptop computers at the conference site. Workshop presenters are responsible for distribution of workshop software to participants prior to the Symposium. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium Committee recommends that presenters of hands-on workshops provide enrollees a URL pointing to all necessary software and instructions for installation (SIGCSE cannot host the material, but there are myriad cloud services available). SIGCSE will provide presenters with mailing lists containing the emails of current enrollees soon after the close of the early registration window and again after the close of the late registration window. We will also collect the software distribution URLs and make them available to on-site registrants. 

Proposers of hands-on workshops should indicate which of the following formats they wish for their workshop:

* **Laptop Required**. Participants should bring a laptop to participate.

* **Laptop Recommended**. It is recommended, but not required, that participants bring a laptop.
	
* **Laptop Optional**. It is not necessary for participants to bring laptops.
	
* **Laptop Not Required**. Participants do not need a laptop.
