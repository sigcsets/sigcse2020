## What is a Panel Session?

Panel sessions provide an opportunity for expert panel members to present their views on a specific topic and then to discuss these views among themselves and with the audience. Usually, a panel session starts with a brief introduction of the panel topic and the participants, followed by short presentations by the panelists giving their views. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. The session must allow sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive question and answer period involving both the panelists and the audience.

A typical panel will consist of four participants, including the moderator. Limiting a panel to four participants allows sufficient time for audience questions. Proposals with more than four panelists must convincingly show that all panelists will be able to speak, and the audience able to respond, within the session time.


**Panel proposal review is NOT blind.** Criteria used in reviewing the proposals include the likely level of interest of the topic, the presence of panel members with multiple perspectives on the topic and significant expertise and experience, and the likelihood that the panel will leave sufficient time for audience participation.

If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the panel description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.


## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?

The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:

<div class="text-center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<a href="{{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}">Formatting requirements, MS Word template, and LaTeX template</a>
</div>

SIGCSE 2020 is NOT participating in the new ACM workflow, template, and production system.  *Word Authors*, please use the Interim Template. *LaTex Authors*, please use the official ACM Master with the `ACM_SigConf` template.

The following modifications and exceptions do apply:

-   When providing author information, indicate which of the panelists
    is the moderator by placing the word "Moderator" in parentheses
    after their name.

-   **Abstract:** Should provide a brief summary of your panel.

- 	**Summary:** The first section should be titled Summary and should provide an expanded summary of the panelâ€™s goals,  intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community written by the moderator.

-	**Panel Structure:** The section following the summary should explain the panel structure and plan for audience participation and provide sufficient time for audience interaction and questions.

-	**Position Statements:** The subsequent sections should contain the position statements of each panelist and a brief description of their expertise and background as it relates to the panel. Title each section by identifying the author.

-	**References:** Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If they are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.

If accepted, the panel description will be allocated
{{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.
