### Paper Submissions

#### Q: How long does the abstract need to be?
A: 250 words

#### Q: What format should I use for abstract submission in the first deadline ({{site.data.cfp.round0.date}})?
A: No format is required, the abstract can be pasted in a form field.

#### Q: Do I have to upload a PDF of the paper for the abstract submission?
A: No, just an abstract pasted in the submission form (together with all the usual information, title of submission, author name(s), affiliation(s), keywords, etc.). No file upload is required.

#### Q: Is the early submission of the abstract required for papers?
A: YES. You must submit an abstract by {{site.data.cfp.round0.date}} for a *paper* submission to be considered.

#### Q: Why are you asking for an abstract a week before the full paper?
A: We will be using paper bidding to assign reviewers to your submission. The bidding will happen based on the abstract. This gives us an extra week for review time and you an extra week to fine tune your submission.
