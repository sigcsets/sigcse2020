{% include submissiondetails.html plural="ACM Student Research Competition" %}

The ***ACM Student Research Competition*** held at the 
SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}} conference will consist of two categories of competition,
graduate and undergraduate, with prizes awarded based on judging during
the conference. **A submission to the Student Research Competition should describe recently completed or ongoing student research in any of the topic areas covered by SIGCSE Technical Symposium.**
All graduate submissions must represent a student’s individual research contribution–neither supervisors or other students are allowed as co-authors. Undergraduate submissions may represent individual or team research contributions. Research completed while the student was an undergraduate may be submitted to the undergraduate category even if the student is now a first-year graduate student. A student must be an ACM student member to qualify for awards and travel grants (up to $500 may be available for students who do not have another source of funding).

## Preparing your ACM Student Research Competition Submission

Students will submit extended abstracts of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} maximum, which will be reviewed to determine acceptance into the Student Research Competition (SRC) at SIGCSE. If accepted into the SRC, an abstract of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}} will be published (see below). 

Qualifying research must deal with topics that are relevant to the mission of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium, as described by the Call for Participation. The author submitting the abstract must still be a student at the time the abstract is due. Each submission should include the author’s name, affiliation, and email address; research advisor’s name; ACM student member number; category (undergraduate or graduate); research title; and an extended abstract (maximum {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} - references may be on the third page) containing the following sections:

* **Abstract**: max {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}}

* **Problem and Motivation**: This section should clearly state the problem being addressed and explain the reasons for seeking a solution to this problem.

* **Background and Related Work**: This section should describe the specialized (but pertinent) background necessary to appreciate the work. Include references to the literature where appropriate, and briefly explain where your work departs from that done by others. Reference lists do not count towards the limit on the length of the abstract.

* **Approach and Uniqueness**: This section should describe your approach in attacking the problem and should clearly state how your approach is novel.

* **Results and Contributions**: This section should clearly show how the results of your work contribute to computer science and should explain the significance of those results.

The paper is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:

<div class="text-center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<a href="{{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}">Formatting requirements, MS Word template, and LaTeX template</a>
</div>

We are using the ACM_SigConf template. If your submission is accepted into the SRC, you will have a chance to modify your abstract of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}} before it is published.

A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using the online submission system - EasyChair.

## Selection Process for ACM Student Research Competition

No more than three research projects will be accepted from a single department and no more than two of those can be in a single category (graduate and undergraduate). Departments are determined by the location of the research advisor. Submissions for the research competition should describe the results of recently completed or ongoing computer science research conducted primarily by students.

## Upon Acceptance of your ACM Student Research Competition Submission

Authors of all accepted submissions will receive instructions on how to submit the publication-ready copy of an abstract of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}} that serves as a succinct description of the project. Deadline and instructions regarding publication-ready submissions are emailed to accepted authors. 

A travel grant covering expenses for travel to SIGCSE, including conference registration, transportation, lodging, and meals, up to a limit of US $500 may be provided to each student whose submission was accepted to the Student Research Competition. Students must be members of ACM to qualify for these awards.

## At the Conference

Judges will include professional computer scientists attending the conference activities. Students’ research will be evaluated on the quality and significance of the work, and the quality and clarity of both an oral and visual presentation.

At SIGCSE, the first round of the competition evaluates the research during a poster presentation. Those students who are selected by the judges to advance to the second round will continue in the competition by giving a formal, short, conference presentation of their research (10 minute presentation with 5 minutes for Q&A). The top three winners in the undergraduate and graduate categories as determined by the judges’ evaluation of the conference presentations will receive the prizes of $500, $300, and $200, respectively. 

Additional competition details, including information about past winners, can be found on the ACM Student Research Competition home page (https://src.acm.org/).

## After the Conference

Accepted Student Research Competition abstracts (max {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].abstract}}) will be distributed in the SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education proceedings. They will be placed in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

The first-place winners from each category (graduate and undergraduate) will advance to the ACM Grand Finals of the Student Research Competition where the winners of several ACM conferences compete for more prizes and recognition.
