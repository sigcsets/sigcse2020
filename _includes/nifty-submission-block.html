Prepare your Nifty submission using the format specified above.

{% if site.data.cfp.submissionopen %}

{% callout warning %}
Please limit the number of topic choices to no more than 5.  This will help match your submission with reviewers.
{% endcallout %}

Prepare your Nifty submission as specified above. Upload the .zip archive you created using [the online submission system - EasyChair]({{site.data.cfp.submissionurl}}).   lease do not wait until the last minute to submit your documents because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!

Make note of the proposal ID number and password assigned to your submission. You will receive an e-mail message confirmation. Spam filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages so you may need to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later, acceptance or rejection notification.

After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy. Send e-mail to the chair(s) (see below) if there are any problems.

{% include submission-not-open.html %}
